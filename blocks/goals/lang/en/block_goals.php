 * On overuse of SMART: (Mark Twain)
 *     When you catch an adjective, kill it. No, I don’t mean utterly, but kill most of them—then the rest will be valuable.
 *     They weaken when they are close together. They give strength when they are wide apart.
 *     An adjective habit, or a wordy, diffuse, flowery habit, once fastened upon a person, is as hard to get rid of as any other vice.

If you do not already have an account on this site, you will need to create one before accepting the invitation and watch our welcome video here: https://learn.rcvsknowledge.org/course/view.php?id=9.
In most mail programs, these links should appear in blue which you can click on to open. If that doesn\'t work, then copy and paste the address into the address line at the top of your web browser.

Why join?
By joining, you will be able to work with your team to safeguard animal health and welfare by promoting responsible antimicrobial use and share experiences of best practice approaches to antimicrobial stewardship.

What is Farm Vet Champions?
The Farm Vet Champions is a project, led by RCVS Knowledge,  in collaboration with a host of other specialist veterinary organisations and practices, all working together to provide a way for the veterinary community to network, learn, and improve responsible use of antimicrobials. The project provides free bite-sized online on-demand learning, with over 20 hours of free CPD, and this online tool for teams to set and track SMART goals that are relevant to their areas of work.

What happens to the information that I enter in this online tool?
You will be able to set and track SMART goals as an individual or as a member of a team. Your individual SMART goals will only be visible to you and only you can edit these. However, your team SMART goals will be editable and shared with the whole team. For further information about this tool and about your SMART Goals account please visit https://rcvsknowledge.org/document-library/plan-prevent-protect-information
